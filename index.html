		 <h4>This Week's Scriptures</h4>
		 <ul>
		   <li><a href = "https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+1%3A3-5&version=NLT">2 Timothy 1:3-5 </a> </li>
		   <li><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Timothy+3%3A14-15&version=NLT">2 Timothy 3:14-15 </a></li>
		 </ul>
		 <h2>Pointers</h2>
		 <ul>
		   <li>Faith always produces and reproduces.</li>
		   <li>Just as it is important to have biological parents, it is important to have spiritual parents.</li>
		   <li>God puts people in our lives purposely- because He sees where we are going.</li>
		   <li>God will never send us to an environment where He has not prepared us to be.</li>
		   <li>God positions us every season for something He has for us.</li>
		   <li>Paul speaks of the Lois and Eunice and how God had placed them purposely that Timothy could benefit from the faith that they had.</li>
		   <li>Paul implies that it is by these women's (Lois' and Eunice's) faith and prayer that Timothy is standing where he was.</li>
		   <li>By extension, God has placed the mothers in our lives for where we are going.</li>
		   <li>To the women, your faith will follow you throughout generations.</li>
		   <li>There is no better gift we can pass on than the Faith and trust in the ability of God</li>
		   <li>We will never know whether we have influenced other people until we have influenced them.</li>
		   <li>God has wired women to be problem solvers.</li>
		   <li>We have to honor the mother figures, the women of faith in our lives because they speak life into us; they position us for our greatness.</li>
		   <li>We may not have a biological mother around, but God will always position a mother figure to fill the gap.</li>
		   <li>Paul in writing to Timothy wants him not to forget the instructions he got.</li>
		   <li>Any person/child that values the instructtions of people who have been there gain more than what money and time cannot buy. </li>
		   <li>God has wired all of us to be people of influence. </li>
		 </ul>
